- `Invalid dereference from a nullptr on address(undefined)` and `[109] [Program failed; see console.errors for more details] Error: Failed` on macOS with libstdc++ v19 and C++ compiler `8.1.0`. Output will continue as soon as "break at Invalid dereference" event, which may contain the stack trace containing our code that was passed incorrectly in the example above. For instance - our pointer value has type `int`, its base address (4) is not actually correct any long.
