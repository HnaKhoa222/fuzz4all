In general use, one must ask for a bug to be triaged as a potential C++ bug even in cases like this, so even experienced C++ professionals are highly recommended.  This is intended to facilitate discussion between people in different domains (including programming experienced individuals and others of more complex programs/languages) so we know you've already figured this issue apart, but your judgement may differ.  If your bug has caused you headache later, see [Finding an error when writing high-performance application in C] (Finding an error) or [Finding mistakes](Finding-makes).
