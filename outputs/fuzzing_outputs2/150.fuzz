    Generating sample code. Use a variety of random statements and control flow including variable initialization without being precise on an intensive.  These are equivalent to "valid" C++ code: \code \{\{.code\}\. \}{(code)}. A variety of C++ statements allows execution to get from start downwards.  They look like the following:

static std::pair<int(*)const, decltype((T()){})> s =
std::{[this] \(void\* c){(VoidReturn)0 },[static = Clang 9](
this \},sizeof(T{0}{}));
        }
