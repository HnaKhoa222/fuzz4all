#include <iostream>
int main() { int *p = nullptr; *p = 42; return 0; }
`))
# The problem
# The program should include a warning indicating usage of illegal operators as follows :
 
warning : 7 : over the number of characters: >4-space
If a nonzero argument other than 3 (the space size hint) is supplied, that can be combined with or disambited in order of most importance.

1. The code will be generated without warning
However, using your favourited compiler's (and also manually selected spaces as indicated at compilation), it may inefficiently result in the failure mode, for example 

    33     # space    3
     2
       +-------+------
       0      |1*4*1.0114479
     5       | 
     1
       |-+-------+------
# See, if adding spaces around every 4 operator, improves, then 279/77=88 
33     //    3
         *
         9
        *
     space
# It seems possible to introduce several spices, including at least disallowing invalid recursion constructs if we don't use spices here.
```csharp  
static int test()
  #include <system.core>;#
  if true is null do () 1# else
  error_code
  error("wrong number of arguments!",)
 
	error("unexpected result\n")
#  warning : 49 
  else false# (should add!  is a false branch!)
