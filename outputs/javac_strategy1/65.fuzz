public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { String s = null; System.out.println(s.length()); } }

This issue is known to be affecting all versions of Java, Java SE, and Java EE.

This is more severe when the Java compiler cannot infer the intended type of a variable or a value before the variable is assigned to it, such as assignment in a switch-case statement.
